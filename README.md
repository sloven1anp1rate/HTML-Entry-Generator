# HTML Entry Generator
### DESCRIPTION
EntryForge is a fast, lightweight tool designed to generate clean, structured HTML entries with zero friction. Built for creators who manage large libraries of films, series, games, or digital projects, it turns your inputs into a fully formatted HTML page — complete with auto‑date, CRT‑styled image preview, download box, and neatly organized description. 

Instead of manually writing repetitive HTML blocks, EntryForge automates the entire process. You enter the title, type, seeders, leechers, descriptions, and image link — and it instantly outputs a ready‑to‑paste HTML template that looks consistent every time. It’s perfect for personal archives, project pages, or any system where you need fast, reliable, repeatable entries.

EntryForge focuses on clarity, speed, and comfort: simple UI, clean code output, and a retro‑inspired aesthetic that makes the generated pages feel unique and alive.
